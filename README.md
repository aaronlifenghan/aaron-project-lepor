LEPOR: machine translation evaluation metric, Open source for research purpose
===================



LEPOR is a language independent machine translation evaluation metric. LEPOR is open source, free for research purpose.
Experiments on ACL-WMT11 corpora (English to German, French, Spanish, Czech; and the reverse direction) show LEPOR 
yields higher correlation scores with human judgments at system-level, as compared to BLEU, METEOR, TER, MP4IBM1, and 
AMBER evaluation metrics. Detailed knowledge of LEPOR is shown in the paper "LEPOR: A Robust Evaluation Metric for 
Machine Translation with Augmented Factors" by Aaron Li-Feng Han, Derek F. Wong and Lidia S. Chao, in Proceedings of
the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2012): Posters, pages 441â€“450, Mumbai, 
December 2012. Source code: https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/aaron-project-lepor &
