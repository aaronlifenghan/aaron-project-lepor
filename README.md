LEPOR: machine translation evaluation metric, Open source for research purpose
===================



LEPOR is a language independent machine translation evaluation metric. LEPOR is open source, free for research purpose.
Experiments on ACL-WMT11 corpora (English to German, French, Spanish, Czech; and the reverse direction) show LEPOR 
yields higher correlation scores with human judgments at system-level, as compared to BLEU, METEOR, TER, MP4IBM1, and 
AMBER evaluation metrics. Detailed knowledge of LEPOR is shown in the paper "LEPOR: A Robust Evaluation Metric for 
Machine Translation with Augmented Factors" by Aaron Li-Feng Han, Derek F. Wong and Lidia S. Chao, in Proceedings of
the 24th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2012), pages 441â€“450, Mumbai, 
December 2012. Source code: https://github.com/aaronlifenghan/aaron-project-lepor &

The enhanced version of the metrics hLEPOR and nLEPOR are introduced in the paper "Unsupervised Quality Estimation Model for English to German Translation and Its Application in Extensive Supervised Evaluation" by Aaron Li-Feng Han, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao, Liangye He and Yi Lu. 2013. The Scientific World Journal, Issue: Recent Advances in Information Technology. Hindawi Publishing Corporation.
